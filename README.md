# ⚽ PredictPro – AI-Powered Football Match Prediction Engine

PredictPro is a production-ready, machine learning-powered football prediction system. It leverages Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Celery, and Docker to deliver accurate, real-time match predictions based on historical and signal-driven data.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework:** FastAPI
- **Task Queue:** Celery + Redis
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM & Migrations:** SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (Recommended)
- **ML Models:** XGBoost, Random Forest, ANN

## 🚀 Features

- 15+ football prediction signals (form, goals, odds, etc.)
- Match result prediction API (RESTful)
- Background task processing via Celery
- Scalable Dockerized deployment
- Alembic-managed schema migrations
- Ready for CI/CD and production rollout

## 📡 Data Source

PredictPro uses live football data powered by [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/), including:

- Historical match results
- Pre-match team statistics
- League standings and xG metrics
- Goals, BTTS, win-draw-loss trends, and more

The system is **API-agnostic**. Its data ingestion layer is modular and can be easily swapped for any compatible football API.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 📦 1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/Lumeria1/PredictPro.git  
cd PredictPro

### 🐳 2. Run with Docker Compose

docker-compose up --build

This will spin up:

- FastAPI app on `http://localhost:8000`
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (for Celery)
- Celery worker (via `celery_worker.py`)

### 🛠 3. Apply DB Migrations

docker-compose exec web alembic upgrade head

## 🧪 Running Tests

pytest

> _Coming soon: Add `tests/` directory with Pytest unit & integration tests._

## 📈 Sample Metrics (demo stats)

- 🔮 Over 5,000 match predictions served per season
- ⚡ Average API response: <250ms (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ CI/CD ready – deployable on Render, Fly.io, or VPS

## 🧠 Machine Learning

Models trained on:

- Historical match data
- League-specific patterns
- Odds and betting signals

Supports:

- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

ML training and evaluation handled outside the main API. Only the final model inference is exposed via `/predict`.
